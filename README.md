### Data Cleaning & Transformation

Imported and cleaned multi-sheet Excel data using Power Query.

Automated column transformations using dynamic parameters and reusable functions.

### ETL & Automation

Created a parameter-driven function to dynamically extract and transform new monthly attendance sheets.

Disabled unnecessary query loads and applied automated refresh schedules for efficient resource usage in Power BI Service.

Metrics & DAX Measures

### Built key performance metrics:
▪️ Presence % = (Present + WFH + Half WFH) / Total Working Days

▪️ WFH %, Sick Leave % (SL%)

Used SWITCH and calculated columns/measures for flexible KPI generation using DAX.

### Dashboard Design

Designed an interactive Power BI dashboard with:

▪️ Top-left KPIs (Presence %, WFH %, SL%)

▪️ Monthly trend analysis via area charts with slicers and filters

▪️ Employee-level presence breakdowns for root cause exploration

Added dynamic slicers, drill-down tables, and focus mode charts for deeper insights and stakeholder queries.
